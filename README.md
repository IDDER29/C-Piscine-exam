# Piscine-exam

Get ready for your 1337/42 exams

# Your mission

Every Friday, you will face an exam machine, but first, you have to log in to your session, and sadly I can't help you with that because as a pisciner you have to discover how you can log into your exam, so, RTFM / Ask your peers.

# Purpose

This git repo provides useful tips to understand how to achieve 100 at 1337/42 exams. However one should not memorize answers if not properly understood.

# How can you help?

You can take a look on this repo in order to practice and get ready to your exams and remember:

- Don't push your exercises with the main function if they ask you to write only a function
- Add a main.c file to exercises that are only functions (if you want to compile while practicing).
- Create exercises inside the correct folders with the correct names before asking the machine to correct your exercises.
- Practice, practice, practice, and good luck.
